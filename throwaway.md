The keyword `ALL` in the `UNION ALL` SQL query has a specific significance and its usage determines how the result sets are combined. Let's break down the query and explain the alternatives.

### Significance of `ALL` in `UNION ALL`:
- **`UNION`**: Combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set, removing duplicate rows.
- **`UNION ALL`**: Combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set, including all duplicates.

In your query:
```sql
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  'Patient' AS role
FROM patients
UNION ALL
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  'Doctor' AS role
FROM doctors;
```
- The `UNION ALL` ensures that all rows from both `patients` and `doctors` tables are included in the result set, even if there are duplicate `first_name` and `last_name` combinations.

### Alternative Syntax Choices:
1. **`UNION`**: If you want to remove duplicate rows from the combined result set:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     first_name,
     last_name,
     'Patient' AS role
   FROM patients
   UNION
   SELECT
     first_name,
     last_name,
     'Doctor' AS role
   FROM doctors;
   ```
   This version will include only unique rows in the final result set.

2. **`INTERSECT`**: Returns only the rows that are common to both `SELECT` statements:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     first_name,
     last_name,
     'Patient' AS role
   FROM patients
   INTERSECT
   SELECT
     first_name,
     last_name,
     'Doctor' AS role
   FROM doctors;
   ```
   Note: The `INTERSECT` operator does not work well with differing literal values like 'Patient' and 'Doctor' in the `role` column, as it expects the same columns and values.

3. **`EXCEPT`** (or `MINUS` in some databases like Oracle): Returns the rows from the first `SELECT` statement that are not present in the second `SELECT` statement:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     first_name,
     last_name,
     'Patient' AS role
   FROM patients
   EXCEPT
   SELECT
     first_name,
     last_name,
     'Doctor' AS role
   FROM doctors;
   ```

### Summary:
- `UNION ALL` includes all rows, including duplicates, from both queries.
- `UNION` removes duplicates from the combined result set.
- `INTERSECT` returns only the common rows between both queries.
- `EXCEPT` returns rows from the first query that are not in the second query.

Choosing between `UNION` and `UNION ALL` depends on whether you need to include duplicates or not in your combined result set. In your example, using `UNION ALL` is appropriate if you want to ensure that all patient and doctor records are included, even if some names are the same.
